#Lab 8
#We were able to run through the program, but we were not sure how to get the date of the file creation as well as the hash of the date.  We were not sure how to get the output and put it on the github.
#Apologies for how late this was turned in.  We were never able to meet up due to differing schedules and Seguy was very busy with his Batallion Commander billet.  We met up a couple of days ago, and we were able to putt this together.
